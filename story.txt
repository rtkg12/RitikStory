A long time ago, in a galaxy far far away lived a guy named Joe. Once, when he was walking back from school, he noticed a big blue box appear out of nowhere. Out of the big blue box, stepped out a man who introduced himself as "The Doctor". He was a time traveller and invited Joe to explore the universe along with him.
