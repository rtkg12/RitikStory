A long time ago, in a galaxy far far away lived a guy named Joe. Once, when he was walking back from school, he noticed a big blue box appear out of nowhere. Out of the big blue box, stepped out a man who introduced himself as "The Doctor". He was a time traveller and invited Joe to explore the universe along with him.

Joe was a bit hesitant at first since all of this was new to him. Regardless, he decided to go with the time traveller. The Doctor pulled out a small computer device and input a random date with some unrecognizable coordinates. Apparently, he not only could move through time, but through space too.

All of a sudden, a DeLorean time machine automobile materialized in front of them. The Doctor said "We have to go back to 1955, Marty!" Before Joe could correct him, the Doc accelerated the DeLorean. Right when it hit 88 MPH, the car disappeared in an implosion of plasma.
